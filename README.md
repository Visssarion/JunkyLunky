# JunkyLunky
### Funky mod that makes your **Spelunky 2** look all **junky and clunky**! 
## Main goals:
- Create a mod that will make the game look funny
- Disfigure the original art of game
- Make you appreciate things after you miss them
- ...and make you bitter! 
## How can I help?
You can help me work on this mod! How? Just work **for** me!

I gotta make them sprite sheets junky, but I am out of creative juice! And if you are full of them, why won't you create your own junkArt™️ and allow for me to use it in the mod?
All I need is for you to redo any of the "not done yet" sprite sheets. Since this mod is junk, you get *bsolute creative freedom on* them. You want to redraw, remodel, photoshop, and uglify them in all ways you know and can!

You can check [the list of all incomplete sprite sheets on this spreadsheet right here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ZORXDflIWBpfGGlH3TkBiOkVJ3KsbVpdSfOedK7p6c/edit?usp=sharing)

You can upload your beautiful art here, by *committing changes to the repository* or just *dm them to me*!
You can contact me on *discord* if you still have any questions: **vissa#2081**
